## News

- **2026-06-10**: Repository upgraded with an official-style README, paper citation metadata, cleaner package interfaces, default configuration, and release-ready project structure.

## Overview

This repository organizes a PyTorch implementation for **SnowMaster: Comprehensive Real-world Image Desnowing via MLLM with Multi-Model Feedback Optimization**, focusing on real-world desnowing with MLLM-guided multi-model feedback. The codebase is structured like a standard research repository so that model components, configuration files, scripts, and evaluation utilities can be extended independently.

Main goals:

- provide a clean PyTorch module layout for the paper;
- keep training, inference, evaluation, and configuration entry points explicit;
- track paper-reported metrics separately from local experiment logs;
- make it easy for contributors to inspect, compare, and extend the implementation.

## Repository Structure

```text
SnowMaster-Unofficial/
├── configs/
│   └── default.yaml
├── scripts/
│   └── smoke_test.py
├── src/snowmaster_unofficial/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── model.py
├── CITATION.cff
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── pyproject.toml
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StaryMoon/SnowMaster-Unofficial.git
cd SnowMaster-Unofficial
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For CUDA-enabled experiments, install the PyTorch build matching your CUDA version from the official PyTorch website before installing the rest of the dependencies.

## Quick Check

Run the minimal forward-pass check:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py
```

Expected output:

```text
output: (...)
loss: ...
```

This confirms that the package import path, model interface, and tensor flow are working.

## Data Preparation

Create local data folders:

```bash
mkdir -p data/train data/val data/test checkpoints outputs
```

Recommended layout:

```text
data/
├── train/
├── val/
└── test/
```

Keep private datasets, downloaded checkpoints, and generated outputs out of git. Dataset-specific converters can be added under `scripts/` while preserving the public repository structure.

## Training

Minimal module usage:

```python
import torch
from snowmaster_unofficial import ModelConfig, UnofficialModel, reconstruction_loss

config = ModelConfig(task="restoration", hidden_dim=128, num_layers=2, num_heads=4)
model = UnofficialModel(config)
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)

x = torch.randn(2, 3, 64, 64)
condition = torch.randn(2, 4, config.hidden_dim)
target = torch.zeros(2, config.output_dim)

out = model(x, condition=condition)
loss = reconstruction_loss(out.primary, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

The repository separates model code, configuration, experiment outputs, and evaluation logs so new components can be added without changing the public interface.

## Inference

```python
import torch
from snowmaster_unofficial import UnofficialModel

model = UnofficialModel().eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    x = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
    y = model(x).primary
print(y.shape)
```

## Evaluation

Suggested entry points:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py
# python scripts/evaluate.py --config configs/default.yaml --ckpt checkpoints/model.pt
```

Paper-reported values and local run values should be kept in separate columns so readers can distinguish citation numbers from local experiment logs.
